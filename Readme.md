# SDFBooleanEngine
This is a learning project for learning Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)

## Learning Roadmap
### Basic 
* Render SDF by different predefined SDF primitives
* Boolean operations on SDFs
* A user-friendly UI to rotate and translate SDF primitive
### Advance
* Marching cube algorithm to extract mesh from final CSG
### Future work
* Incoporate Model contex protocol (MCP) to let LLMs create a complicated CSG by a simple prompt
